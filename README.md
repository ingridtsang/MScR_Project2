# MScR_Project2


## This Repo's Structure
The code has been separated out into 3 folders:
- "Raw code" (an absolute mess, reflecting the fact that I was working across multiple machines, which I would not recommed going into unless armed with painkillers)
- "Cleaned code" (somewhat cleaned versions of code that contributed directly to the work in the thesis; so testing of packages/parameters etc. are not included)
- "Base code" (the basic code that I used for each step of the analysis, but sanitized and written with annotations so it is both a guide through the analysis and can be used as a template for other datasets)

## Assumptions in Code 
The data (and file structure)
- This code assumes that the data is from a 10X platform (as of 2020) and has already been aligned. 
- The starting files should be "barcodes.tsv", "genes.tsv" and "matrix.mtx" for each sample
